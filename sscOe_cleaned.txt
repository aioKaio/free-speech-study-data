The protesters have done more to harm the Democratic party, than Trump supporters ever could. Democrats are now laughed at because we are not seen as sensible and tolerant as we once professed to be. It's a shame to watch the militant liberal left take the party hostage. I am a tolerant open minded liberal. I believe Trump was elected fairly, just as Obama was and if we are patient, his time will pass, just as obama's did. That is the beauty of our two party system. It is like a ball game. The opposing team now has the ball but that is FAIR. It is their turn. Those are the rules of the game. They waited through 8 years of Obama. Who are we to deny them a turn? So now we light ourselves on fire, so to speak, in protest of a democratic election. The far left have become the very thing they hate, intolerant and violent. I would not have believed it if I had not seen it in my lifetime.

The people rioting are not helping Democrats. They are all wearing black and covering their faces and damaging property and hurting people. Who are these people? They do not act like free Americans. The reason our country is the greatest on earth is precisely because we have freedoms that other country's don't have. If we stifle free speech, how will we know which people we'd rather not associate with and who might be dangerous. Mentally ill people are especially hurt by this as they don't always have good self control. We need to know them through their speech and thus be able to help them. I believe pushing our views on others has brought Donald Trump into office. If we had left the Christians alone and done our own thing without making them do what we wanted we would show our superiority for understanding and love. As a Democrat, I want to be an example of tolerance not of hate. We Democrats say we believe in Climate change SCIENCE but we don't believe in GENDER body science. We're all over the map these days. Why can we not be happy for the winner, show our respect for the result, and work hard so next time we can be the winners, by showing our goodness? What happened to love trumps hate? To be honest, I do believe Islam has infiltrated our prison system and is exploiting vulnerable impressionable people. Islam is not compatible with freedom, especially women's freedoms. If we let them take hold in America, we Democratic women will be subjugated against our will. Christians allow women to choose, muslims do not. Maybe I'm more of a critical thinker yet I hope women will wake up and educate themselves to the danger of Islam if it's not too late.
